<center><h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h2>APPEARANCE AND REALITY
</h2>
</center>
<p>I<font size="-1">S</font> there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that
no reasonable man could doubt it? This question, which at first sight
might not seem difficult, is really one of the most difficult that
can be asked. When we have realized the obstacles in the way of a
straightforward and confident answer, we shall be well launched on
the study of philosophy -- for philosophy is merely the attempt to
answer such ultimate questions, not carelessly and dogmatically, as
we do in ordinary life and even in the sciences, but critically after
exploring all that makes such questions puzzling, and after realizing
all the vagueness and confusion that underlie our ordinary ideas.

</p><p></p><dd>In daily life, we assume as certain many things which, on a
closer scrutiny, are found to be so full of apparent contradictions
that only a great amount of thought enables us to know what it is
that we really may believe. In the search for certainty, it is
natural to begin with our present experiences, and in some sense, no
doubt, knowledge is to be derived from them. But any statement as to
what it is that our immediate experiences make us know is very likely
to be wrong. It seems to me that I am now sitting in a chair, at a
table of a certain shape, on which I see sheets of paper with writing
or print. By turning my head I see out of the window buildings and
clouds and the sun. I believe that the sun is about ninety-three
million miles from the earth; that it is a hot globe many times
bigger than the earth; that, owing to the earth's rotation, it rises
every morning, and will continue to do so for an indefinite time in
the future. I believe that, if any other normal person comes into my
room, he will see the same chairs and tables and books and papers as
I see, and that the table which I see is the same as the table which
I feel pressing against my arm. All this seems to be so evident as to
be hardly worth stating, except in answer to a man who doubts whether
I know anything. Yet all this may be reasonably doubted, and all of
it requires much careful discussion before we can be sure that we
have stated it in a form that is wholly true.

<p></p></dd><dd>To make our difficulties plain, let us concentrate attention
on the table. To the eye it is oblong, brown and shiny, to the touch
it is smooth and cool and hard; when I tap it, it gives out a wooden
sound. Any one else who sees and feels and hears the table will agree
with this description, so that it might seem as if no difficulty
would arise; but as soon as we try to be more precise our troubles
begin. Although I believe that the table is 'really' of the same
colour all over, the parts that reflect the light look much brighter
than the other parts, and some parts look white because of reflected
light. I know that, if I move, the parts that reflect the light will
be different, so that the apparent distribution of colours on the
table will change. It follows that if several people are looking at
the table at the same moment, no two of them will see exactly the
same distribution of colours, because no two can see it from exactly
the same point of view, and any change in the point of view makes
some change in the way the light is reflected.

<p></p></dd><dd>For most practical purposes these differences are unimportant, 
but to the painter they are all-important: the painter has to unlearn
the habit of thinking that things seem to have the colour which
common sense says they 'really' have, and to learn the habit of
seeing things as they appear. Here we have already the beginning of
one of the distinctions that cause most trouble in philosophy -- the
distinction between 'appearance' and 'reality', between what things
seem to be and what they are. The painter wants to know what things
seem to be, the practical man and the philosopher want to know what
they are; but the philosopher's wish to know this is stronger than
the practical man's, and is more troubled by knowledge as to the
difficulties of answering the question.

<p></p></dd><dd>To return to the table. It is evident from what we have found, 
that there is no colour which preeminently appears to be <i>the</i>
colour of the table, or even of any one particular part of the table
-- it appears to be of different colours from different points of
view, and there is no reason for regarding some of these as more
really its colour than others. And we know that even from a given
point of view the colour will seem different by artificial light, or
to a colour-blind man, or to a man wearing blue spectacles, while in
the dark there will be no colour at all, though to touch and hearing
the table will be unchanged. This colour is not something which is
inherent in the table, but something depending upon the table and the
spectator and the way the light falls on the table. When, in ordinary
life, we speak of <i>the</i> colour of the table, we only mean the
sort of colour which it will seem to have to a normal spectator from
an ordinary point of view under usual conditions of light. But the
other colours which appear under other conditions have just as good a
right to be considered real; and therefore, to avoid favouritism, we
are compelled to deny that, in itself, the table has any one
particular colour.

<p></p></dd><dd>The same thing applies to the texture. With the naked eye one
can see the gram, but otherwise the table looks smooth and even. If
we looked at it through a microscope, we should see roughnesses and
hills and valleys, and all sorts of differences that are
imperceptible to the naked eye. Which of these is the 'real' table?
We are naturally tempted to say that what we see through the
microscope is more real, but that in turn would be changed by a still
more powerful microscope. If, then, we cannot trust what we see with
the naked eye, why should we trust what we see through a microscope?
Thus, again, the confidence in our senses with which we began deserts
us.

<p></p></dd><dd>The <i>shape</i> of the table is no better. We are all in
the habit of judging as to the 'real' shapes of things, and we do
this so unreflectingly that we come to think we actually see the real
shapes. But, in fact, as we all have to learn if we try to draw, a
given thing looks different in shape from every different point of
view. If our table is 'really' rectangular, it will look, from almost
all points of view, as if it had two acute angles and two obtuse
angles. If opposite sides are parallel, they will look as if they
converged to a point away from the spectator; if they are of equal
length, they will look as if the nearer side were longer. All these
things are not commonly noticed in looking at a table, because
experience has taught us to construct the 'real' shape from the
apparent shape, and the 'real' shape is what interests us as
practical men. But the 'real' shape is not what we see; it is
something inferred from what we see. And what we see is constantly
changing in shape as we, move about the room; so that here again the
senses seem not to give us the truth about the table itself, but only
about the appearance of the table.

<p></p></dd><dd>Similar difficulties arise when we consider the sense of
touch. It is true that the table always gives us a sensation of
hardness, and we feel that it resists pressure. But the sensation we
obtain depends upon how hard we press the table and also upon what
part of the body we press with; thus the various sensations due to
various pressures or various parts of the body cannot be supposed to
reveal <i>directly</i> any definite property of the table, but at
most to be signs of some property which perhaps <i>causes</i> all
the sensations, but is not actually apparent in any of them. And the
same applies still more obviously to the sounds which can be elicited
by rapping the table.

<p></p></dd><dd>Thus it becomes evident that the real table, if there is one, 
is not the same as what we immediately experience by sight or touch
or hearing. The real table, if there is one, is not
<i>immediately</i> known to us at all, but must be an inference
from what is immediately known. Hence, two very difficult questions
at once arise; namely, (1) Is there a real table at all? (2) If so, 
what sort of object can it be?

<p></p></dd><dd>It will help us in considering these questions to have a few
simple terms of which the meaning is definite and clear. Let us give
the name of 'sense-data' to the things that are immediately known in
sensation: such things as colours, sounds, smells, hardnesses, 
roughnesses, and so on. We shall give the name 'sensation' to the
experience of being immediately aware of these things. Thus, whenever
we see a colour, we have a sensation <i>of</i> the colour, but the
colour itself is a sense-datum, not a sensation. The colour is that
<i>of</i> which we are immediately aware, and the awareness itself
is the sensation. It is plain that if we are to know anything about
the table, it must be by means of the sense-data -- brown colour, 
oblong shape, smoothness, etc. -- which we associate with the table;
but, for the reasons which have been given, we cannot say that the
table is the sense-data, or even that the sense-data are directly
properties of the table. Thus a problem arises as to the relation of
the sense-data to the real table, supposing there is such a thing.

<p></p></dd><dd>The real table, if it exists, we will call a 'physical
object'. Thus we have to consider the relation of sense-data to
physical objects. The collection of all physical objects is called
'matter'. Thus our two questions may be re-stated as follows: (1) Is
there any such thing as matter? (2) If so, what is its nature?

<p></p></dd><dd>The philosopher who first brought prominently forward the
reasons for regarding the immediate objects of our senses as not
existing independently of us was Bishop Berkeley (1685-1753). His
<cite>Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous, in Opposition to
Sceptics and Atheists</cite>, undertake to prove that there is no
such thing as matter at all, and that the world consists of nothing
but minds and their ideas. Hylas has hitherto believed in matter, but
he is no match for Philonous, who mercilessly drives him into
contradictions and paradoxes, and makes his own denial of matter
seem, in the end, as if it were almost common sense. The arguments
employed are of very different value: some are important and sound, 
others are confused or quibbling. But Berkeley retains the merit of
having shown that the existence of matter is capable of being denied
without absurdity, and that if there are any things that exist
independently of us they cannot be the immediate objects of our
sensations.

<p></p></dd><dd>There are two different questions involved when we ask whether
matter exists, and it is important to keep them clear. We commonly
mean by 'matter' something which is opposed to 'mind', something
which we think of as occupying space and as radically incapable of
any sort of thought or consciousness. It is chiefly in this sense
that Berkeley denies matter; that is to say, he does not deny that
the sense-data which we commonly take as signs of the existence of
the table are really signs of the existence of <i>something</i>
independent of us, but he does deny that this something is nonmental, 
that it is neither mind nor ideas entertained by some mind. He admits
that there must be something which continues to exist when we go out
of the room or shut our eyes, and that what we call seeing the table
does really give us reason for believing in something which persists
even when we are not seeing it. But he thinks that this something
cannot be radically different in nature from what we see, and cannot
be independent of seeing altogether, though it must be independent of
<i>our</i> seeing. He is thus led to regard the 'real' table as an
idea in the mind of God. Such an idea has the required permanence and
independence of ourselves, without being -- as matter would otherwise
be -- something quite unknowable, in the sense that we can only infer
it, and can never be directly and immediately aware of it.

<p></p></dd><dd>Other philosophers since Berkeley have also held that, 
although the table does not depend for its existence upon being seen
by me, it does depend upon being seen (or otherwise apprehended in
sensation) by <i>some</i> mind -- not necessarily the mind of God, 
but more often the whole collective mind of the universe. This they
hold, as Berkeley does, chiefly because they think there can be
nothing real -- or at any rate nothing known to be real except minds
and their thoughts and feelings. We might state the argument by which
they support their view in some such way as this: 'Whatever can be
thought of is an idea in the mind of the person thinking of it;
therefore nothing can be thought of except ideas in minds; therefore
anything else is inconceivable, and what is inconceivable cannot
exist.'

<p></p></dd><dd>Such an argument, in my opinion, is fallacious; and of course
those who advance it do not put it so shortly or so crudely. But
whether valid or not, the argument has been very widely advanced in
one form or another; and very many philosophers, perhaps a majority, 
have held that there is nothing real except minds and their ideas.
Such philosophers are called 'idealists'. When they come to
explaining matter, they either say, like Berkeley, that matter is
really nothing but a collection of ideas, or they say, like Leibniz
(1646-1716), that what appears as matter is really a collection of
more or less rudimentary minds.

<p></p></dd><dd>But these philosophers, though they deny matter as opposed to
mind, nevertheless, in another sense, admit matter. It will be
remembered that we asked two questions; namely, (1) Is there a real
table at all? (2) If so, what sort of object can it be? Now both
Berkeley and Leibniz admit that there is a real table, but Berkeley
says it is certain ideas in the mind of God, and Leibniz says it is a
colony of souls. Thus both of them answer our first question in the
affirmative, and only diverge from the views of ordinary mortals in
their answer to our second question. In fact, almost all philosophers
seem to be agreed that there is a real table. they almost all agree
that, however much our sense-data -- colour, shape, smoothness, etc.
-- may depend upon us, yet their occurrence is a sign of something
existing independently of us, something differing, perhaps, 
completely from our sense-data whenever we are in a suitable relation
to the real table.

<p></p></dd><dd>Now obviously this point in which the philosophers are agreed
-- the view that there is a real table, whatever its nature may be is
vitally important, and it will be worth while to consider what
reasons there are for accepting this view before we go on to the
further question as to the nature of the real table. Our next
chapter, therefore, will be concerned with the reasons for supposing
that there is a real table at all.

<p></p></dd><dd> Before we go farther it will be well to consider for a moment
what it is that we have discovered so far. It has appeared that, if
we take any common object of the sort that is supposed to be known by
the senses, what the senses <i>immediately</i> tell us is not the
truth about the object as it is apart from us, but only the truth
about certain sense-data which, so far as we can see, depend upon the
relations between us and the object. Thus what we directly see and
feel is merely 'appearance', which we believe to be a sign of some
'reality' behind. But if the reality is not what appears, have we any
means of knowing whether there is any reality at all? And if so, have
we any means of finding out what it is like?

<p></p></dd><dd>Such questions are bewildering, and it is difficult to know
that even the strangest hypotheses may not be true. Thus our familiar
table, which has roused but the slightest thoughts in us hitherto, 
has become a problem full of surprising possibilities. The one thing
we know about it is that it is not what it seems. Beyond this modest
result, so far, we have the most complete liberty of conjecture.
Leibniz tells us it is a community of souls: Berkeley tells us it is
an idea in the mind of God; sober science, scarcely less wonderful, 
tells us it is a vast collection of electric charges in violent
motion.

<p></p></dd><dd>Among these surprising possibilities, doubt suggests that
perhaps there is no table at all. Philosophy, if it cannot answer so
many questions as we could wish, has at least the power of asking
questions which increase the interest of the world, and show the
strangeness and wonder lying just below the surface even in the
commonest things of daily life.
